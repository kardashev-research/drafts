        <h1>Sociology</h1>
        <h2>Sociological imagination of progress</h2>
        <b>(Draft status: 42%)</b>

          For much of human history, society had been a collection of families and communities, and the community spirit was fostered by ideas of honor, service and loyalty. Religion and culture created a collective consciousness that provided solidarity to communities in a large society. The self-interest demanded by capitalism in recent centuries weakens our values, and we are ultimately leading to social collapse where we may lose belongingness with communities or even our families.

          A contemporary of the Age of Enlightenment, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ferguson">Adam Ferguson (1723-1816)</a> felt that commercial growth was happening at the expense of traditional values of cooperation. More people nowadays demand change through competition rather than seeking order through cooperation. During the Industrial Revolution, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)</a> identified that economic inequality arises as materials and/or means of their production are privately held. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx">Karl Marx (1818-1883)</a> identified four historical epochs: early human society would have been classless with primitive communism, then slavery divided ancient society in masters and slaves, feudalism divided society in aristocratic elite and peasants, and capitalism divides society in bourgeoisie (owners) and proletariat (workers). Marx believed social progress is about resolving the class conflict due to economic exploitation: owners are enriched while workers remain poor.

          Industrialization, which preceded capitalism, was a product of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution">Scientific Revolution (16th and 17th centuries)</a> that brought about radical changes to what constituted sound knowledge in the 18th century. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment (17th and 18th centuries)</a>, progress was understood in economic terms of industrial productivity and scientific discovery, a perspective that is somewhat popular even today. Witnessing the birth of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">Industrial Revolution (18th and 19th centuries)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Comte">Auguste Comte (1798–1857)</a> challenged this perspective with the proposition that valid knowledge of anything (even progress) can only be derived through scientific inquiry. <i>Sociology</i> was developed to distinguish social progress from technological progress (which comes about through <i>Technology</i>). With On the Origin of Species by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Charles Darwin (1809-1882)</a> evolution was introduced, a biological progress (which comes about through <i>Biology</i>). It provoked a radical rethinking of what progress means. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer">Herbert Spencer (1820-1903)</a> portrayed society as an evolving organism with interrelated parts serving different complementary functions, which inspired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim">Émile Durkheim (1858-1917)</a> to identify interdependence in division of labor as the basis of solidarity in industrial society, as opposed to collective consciousness as the basis of solidarity in primitive societies. With industrialization, society is evolving to become a complex organism with continuous sophistication through division and specialization of labor. Interdependence of individuals is the basis of cohesion in modern society (Gesellschaft). Collective consciousness (Wesenwille) diminishes as people differentiate during their rationalized pursuits (Kürwille). Yet, it continues to subconsciously motivate formation and preservation of small social groupings (Gemeinschafts) marked by community spirit.

        <p>
          Following the Industrial Revolution, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber">Max Weber (1864–1920)</a> noted that the machine-like effectiveness and efficiency demanded in rationalized pursuits made bureaucratization of social administration (rigid legal rules, specialization and hierarchy) inevitable. It led to dehumanization of individuals in the bureaucratic middle class as cogs in machines. Because the primary goal of rationalization is to get things done efficiently, the desires of the individual are subservient to the goals of the bureaucracy, leading to a loss of individual autonomy. Individuals then struggle to acquire a better job (status), more money (wealth), or more prestige (power), as their creativity is valued less than their productivity. The erosion of spiritual values (Wesenwille) means their social actions are instead based on calculations of cost and benefit (Kürwille), and they become a matter more of administration (as workers) than moral or social guidance (as students). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Wright_Mills">Charles Wright Mills (1916–1962)</a> noted that mass society was unaware of the way in which their lives are affected by concentration of political and social power in the power elite. Individuals continued to perceive their troubles, such as becoming unemployed, or ending up homeless or in debt, as personal failures and not in terms of forces of historical change. This is due to the lack of sociological imagination in the mass society.

          Until the mid-20th century, much of Sociology believed people’s behavior could be predicted by finding the underlying rules of society, but the dynamics had changed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Garfinkel">Harold Garfinkel (1917–2011)</a> observed that the ‘underlying’ rules of macroscopic social change and order were instead built from the everyday microscopic actions of people in different situations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault">Michel Foucault (1926–1984)</a> explained power relations as the major force of social order. For example, institutions such as prisons, asylums, hospitals, schools, and police exercise disciplinary power: specifically, monitoring and acting to prevent people from behaving in certain ways; characterizing a pervasive sort of power than the notion of mere occasions of public punishment in feudal society. Power is therefore not something someone has, like a weapon, but something that is done to others, an action that affects the action of others. Punitive sovereign power is dismissed, or at least resisted, in modern society as inhuman, while pervasive disciplinary power brings about control as individuals tend to regulate their microscopic behaviors according to norms shaped in the situations of a prison cell, a classroom, or a traffic junction. Discourse, and not revolution, is the instrument of power relations and their resistance. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann">Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998)</a> observed that societal systems - the economic, educational, scientific, legal, political, religious, and so on -  consist of communications, and not people (which shall be understood as mere enactors of communications). Drawing from the autopoiesis (pronounced "auto-poy-E-sis") perspective in <i>Biology</i> and laws of form perspective in <i>Mathematics</i>, he remarked on operational closedness of communications and the lack of integration in systems by design. This highlights the importance of structural couplings - certain entities that help to connect separated systems by translating the communications produced by one system into terms that the other can understand.

          With The Metropolis and Mental Life, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Simmel">Georg Simmel (1858-1918)</a> explained how in urban society an individual was largely unknown to those who surrounded them, unlike rural society where individuals would be intimately familiar with those around them. The rapid tempo of life in a city demanded people to develop a ‘blasé attitude’ insulating them from excess stimuli; a mechanism to cope with the mental disturbance created by immersion in city life. For example, minimizing social interaction in public by avoiding eye contact. With The McDonaldization of Society (1993), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ritzer">George Ritzer (1940-)</a> remarked on components of extreme rationalization in 21st century businesses: efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control. Efficiency is marked by predesigned processes that lead to specified ends. Calculability is marked by quantification and the proposition that bigger the better i.e. more quantity is more quality. Predictability is marked by providing consistent service across locations and times. Control is marked by use of technology for seamless operation and management of above components. These components have become the dominant cultural template for high competitiveness in several consumer industries worldwide. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Robertson">Roland Robertson (1938-2022)</a> emphasized that the emergence of such globalizing forces does not mean the world is moving toward a single global culture. Rather, local cultures adopt and redefine any global cultural product to suit their particular needs, beliefs, and customs. For example, while Hollywood movies inspired Indian film-makers in the development of Bollywood, the art forms produced are distinct and appeal to local culture. Allowances for local contingencies and contexts (e.g. including of vegetarian burgers on McDonald’s menus in India) lead to glocalization: global forms are modified upon contact with local communities and individuals. With The Disneyization of Society (2004), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bryman">Alan Bryman (1947–2017)</a> remarked on the blurring of reality and fantasy by fake transformation of everyday activities into extraordinary experiences. He identified four aspects to Disneyization: theming, hybrid consumption, merchandising, and emotional labor. Theming is the application of cultural interests to make an establishment or object popular, e.g. rainforest theme in a cafe. Hybrid consumption refers to interlinking of different kinds of consumptions, e.g. shopping malls in airports. Merchandising is promotion and sale of unrelated goods or services with copyrighted images and logos, e.g. coffee mugs with a university’s logo. Emotional labor involves scripted interactions and dress-ups to enact performances for endless entertainment, e.g. commodification of private emotions in a motion picture. The transformation of everyday occurrences, such as shopping and eating, into spectacular and sensational events by such processes undermines the authenticity of experiences in traditional places. Together McDonaldization and Disneyization describe cultural progress of high quantity modes of consumption and high quality modes of experiences for the rational individual.

           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lefebvre">Henri Lefebvre (1901-1991)</a> encouraged social spaces for people to meet on an equal footing despite the power relationships across their diverse identities, and a hope for all classes to participate in rebuilding of cities for freedom of expression, play and creativity across their diverse ways of being. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs">Jane Jacobs (1916–2006)</a> encouraged diversity at the sidewalks instead of segregation of commercial, business and residential areas as sidewalk encounters can help individuals in becoming acquainted with their neighbors and neighborhood.

          Solid modernity came about in the 20th century characterized by industrialization and capitalism. Defining features of solid modernity, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygmunt_Bauman">Zygmunt Bauman (1925-2017)</a>, is the organization of human activity and institutions along bureaucratic lines, where people live with a relatively stable set of norms, traditions and institutions, and social change is relatively ordered and predictable. He regarded solid modernity as realization of the Enlightenment view that reason leads to the emancipation of humankind. The social and political institutions of solid modernity addressed primarily national issues and problems. In the early 21st century, compulsive, obsessive, and addictive reinventing of the world, according to Bauman, has resulted in liquid modernity characterized by risk and unpredictability. Whereas solid modernity came about for streamlining production, liquid modernity came about for rapid and relentless consumption. Individuals nowadays self-create their identity through consumption, as traditional sources of identity, such as employment status and family ties, have withered under liquid modernity. But fluid identities come with a psychologically costly cycle of endless self-questioning and introspection resulting in anxiety and unease about who we are in a rapidly transforming world.
